# Todo App using MongoDB

A simple and efficient Todo application built with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This app allows users to manage their tasks with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Users can add new tasks, edit existing ones, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks that are no longer needed. The application also features authentication to ensure that users' data is secure.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using JWT.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks.
- **Task Prioritization**: Set task priority (High, Medium, Low).
- **Task Status Management**: Manage task status (Pending, In Progress, Completed).
- **Due Date Management**: Set and update due dates for tasks.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile use.
